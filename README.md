# cruise-line-shower-grab-handle-tray
This is a openSCAD design to create an accessory that attaches to the grab handle in the shower.
The accessory holds stuff that is left on the floor or not fitting on the shelf, like shampoo or razor. 

The accessory  stores things normally on the floor and it also has a place to hang a female razor.   
It can be configured to change the size of the tray as well as if we find a grab handle that is not 20mm.   
All/most variables are global and should be easy to customize.       

## testing
### First version tested on Grand Princess   10/2024   
A very raw test not knowing handle diameter or location. I assumed it was 25mm and it was 20mm.
Test unit was installed for more testing with electrical tape.The razor hook worked fine. loose enough, and the razor can't fall through. 
Tray sides too short, it did get bumped, nothing fell out but it could, so a taller wall next.   
These showers are small. Needs the ability to go to both sides of the handle, this one was on the right. Ship bathrooms are mirrors of each other, on the same ship you would need both a left and a right.     
Also might not have any bumping if it is not in the way.  
### next test coming up
