# cruise-line-shower-grab-handle-tray
this is a openSCAD design to create an accesory that attaches to the grab handdle in the shower.   
It is a work-in-progress to be tested on my next cruise.   
It was needed to store things normaly on the floor and also have a place to hang a female razor.
Also can be a soap dish, if you bring your own bar.   
All variables are global and easy to customize.
