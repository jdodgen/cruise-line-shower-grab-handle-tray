# cruise-line-shower-grab-handle-tray
This is a openSCAD design to create an accessory that attaches to the grab handle in the shower.
The accessory holds stuff that is left on the floor or not fitting on the shelf, like shampoo or razor. 

The accessory  stores things normally on the floor and it also has a place to hang a female razor.   
It can be configured to change the size of the tray as well as if we find a grab handle that is not 20mm.   
All/most variables are global and should be easy to customize.
